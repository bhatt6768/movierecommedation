b"This movie is a pathetic propaganda. The soldiers of the Allies didn't escape because of some miricle or something.\nThey survived because Hitler give a order to stop the attack and to let them escape as a sign of peace with UK.\nHitler never whanted to go to war with the western contries, he whanted to deal with the real enemy - the commonism.\nBut for me personal that was one of Hitler's biggest mistakes,  he must destroyed this forces and force UK to surrender, \nthen the WW2 would be finished in less than a year. That fat drunk pig and war criminal Churchill of course didn't whant peace,he whant only war."
b'Imagine anyone other than Christopher Nolan making a WW2 movie that does not show a German soldier once...the man is a Jedi.'
b'Damn Dunkerque'
b"0:08 That's not the leaflet that should have been portrayed. Hitler wanted them to survive and still offered peace instead of more bloodshed.. The allies (elite jews) rejected that peace and wanted war because war makes the best profit."
b'The french ? They saved the british army but it is not important...'
b'Ahhh yes, #killallmen'
b'This movie encourages me to be a soldier though lol\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s sad when they only come to watch Harry Styles'
b"People get fussy because there wasn't enough action. You don't need blood and guts to tell a damn good story. Dunkirk is a story we will tell for generations. This film and the music by Mr. Zimmer made this brilliant."
b"if you're gonna go to the movie just to fawn over harry, then that's a bit rude to dunkirk veterans i think"
b'people bitching and whining about how "ThErEs nO dIsMeMbErMent REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" are fucking melts. What would you want more, a story depicting the horror of survival in one of the most pivotal moments of ww2, or some fancy CGI.'
b'Good movie.'
b'Just finished watching it and I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it . I was lost throughout the whole bloody movie . Maybe I do some research on it'
b"This was not about to entertain you.\n\n\nIt's a story of survival"
b'People who disliked this movie shall not bother watching movies anymore. Better they shall keep their eyes stiched closed forever.'
b"For the first time I didn't wanna watch that movie. But when I could know there is Harry in Dunkirk , in that moment I watched full movie and enjoyed it. Harry is my heart"
b'1:54'
b'USA should have been helping.'
b'Best movie'
b'I really love the junkers in that movie'
b'when this movie release in hindi\nplease dubbed it fast'
b'The same historical event was the subject of the movie Darkest Hour which I have just finished watching and I can say that I was moved by it more than Dunkirk even if this one describes what was happening there. Nolan could have done better than this.'
b'My top 3 War Movies: \n1. Saving Private Ryan\n2. Dunkirk\n3. Battle of Britain (1969)'
b"So epic movie! that when I'm try to explain my son why I'm anglophile."
b"Can't wait for Dunkirk 2, where the great granddaughters of these brave men are groomed and raped by immigrants whilst the boys are jail for criticism."
b'Beaches.\nParadise during peace\nHell during war.'
b"2019 and I still believe Dunkirk is not just a movie.\n\nIt's an experience."
b'booooooooooooring'
b'There are some people here who are like "I\'m here just for Harry". Well, I WAS also here for Harry but after watching the movie, i realized that there\'s so much more than Harry styles. Don\'t get me wrong tho, I love Harry with my whole bloody heart and he did an amazingggg job. I just don\'t get why some people didn\'t like this movie. It\'s a masterpiece, literally. I have to say tho, this movie is a lil confusing but stilllll man it\'s wowowowow'

b"For those of you saying you only want to watch this because of Harry Styles (he was great don't get me wrong) then eont even bother watching of you aren't going to pay respects to those 400 000 men and civilians that narrowly escaped and Dunkirk is the reason that Jews still exist why we have such great music, TV our phones. Pay respect."
